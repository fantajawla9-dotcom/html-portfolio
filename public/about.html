<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm a Web Developer student with big dreams and an even bigger passion for programming. I’m currently learning everything I can about web technologies—from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to modern frameworks like React and Node.js.

My goal? To become a well-known and respected programmer who creates tools, apps, and experiences that make a real difference. I believe in writing clean, efficient code and never stopping when it comes to learning and growing. Right now, I'm working on personal projects, sharpening my skills, and preparing myself for the opportunities ahead.</p>
